# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a designer to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

Simply put, Strategy Pattern is useful when you have multiple algorithms to perform the same task using different implementations. It allows you to define these algorithms in separate classes, making it easier to switch between them at runtime depending on the specific context or requirement.Â 

The key components of the Strategy Pattern include:

1. Strategy Interface/Abstract Class: This is a common interface that is used by all the concrete classes.
2. Concrete Strategies: These are the actual implementations of the algorithm defined in the strategy interface. Each concrete class encapsulates a specific algorithm.
3. Context: This is the class that uses strategy objects. Based on the use case, any strategy can be used.

By using this pattern, you can achieve greater flexibility and maintainability in the code, as you can easily add a new algorithm without touching existing code.
